# Scaling horizontally a web service

## The Pdfmagic service [40']

### Overview

*[Q] Quickly browse through the source code of the Pdfmagic service.
Where is located the pdf document on the server before being sent back
to the client?*

The pdf document will be located in ``/tmp`` folder.  
The document will be named ``<uuid>.jpg``.

### A container to hold the magic

*[Q] Run the container locally and access it to create a pdf document from
a jpg image. Convert the logo located here. Where is the pdf document
on the server?*

The ``Dockerfile`` we used is shown below.

```Dockerfile
# Base Docker Image
FROM python:2

# Working Directory
WORKDIR /container

# Dependencies 
RUN pip install delegator.py 
RUN pip install web.py

# Add Python file to working directory
ADD pdfmagic/pdfmagic.py /container

# Expose container's port to clients  
EXPOSE 8080

# Command that runs on the container
CMD ["python", "/container/pdfmagic.py"]
```

Then, we can create the Docker image.
```bash
docker built -t pdfimage .
```

Finally, we can start the container, making a bridge between host and containers
ports 8080.
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 pdfimage
```

Once the service is used from a container, the pdf document will be located
in the ``/tmp`` folder of the container, which means directly
in the docker image.
